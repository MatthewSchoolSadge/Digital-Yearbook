            <h2>John Cedrick Velarde Agapay</h2>
            <p>John Cedrick Velarde Agapay, born on December 13, 2000, is the eldest among his three siblings. He completed his Elementary and Junior High School education at Siena College Tigaon, formerly known as Sta. Clara College. In 2018, he did not complete his Senior High School Grade 11 at the University of Nueva Caceres and instead chose to focus on self-discovery. During this period, Cedrick identified his potential in painting and drawing, inspired by his former Senior High classmate and friend, Jay Anthony Celimen, a renowned painter from Gainza Camarines Sur, known for his work on the Divino Rostro.</p>
            <p>Throughout 2019, Cedrick dedicated his time to learning and enhancing various artistic techniques. In the latter part of the year, he sold his first painting to a relative, marking a significant milestone in his life. Motivated by this success, Cedrick decided to resume his studies, completing Grade 11 in the academic year 2020-2021 at the University of Nueva Caceres.</p>
            <p>Post-Grade 11, Cedrick sought employment away from his parents and secured a position at the well-known Monde Nissin Corporation in the Philippines. Following the expiration of his contract, he returned to his province to pursue his passion for painting. In August 2023, Cedrick made his debut in Naga City at his first exhibit organized by the Rigmat Arts and Culture group. The event attracted local artists from Bicol and beyond, with National Artists like Benedicto "bencab" Cabrera, Ryan Cayabyab, and Alice Reyes in attendance. Cedrick showcased his recent artwork titled "Mater Dolorosa," and the piece garnered interest from potential buyers. Currently, he continues his education, completing Grade 12, and remains dedicated to enhancing his skills in the field of fashion.</p>
